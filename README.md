# Fortnite Bot Royale
This is based on AjaxFNC's [NexBL V1](https://github.com/AjaxFNC-YT/NexBL-V1/), i've updated a lot of code to try to stabilize the bot.<br>
<br>
It's mostly stable and usable now, tho it may take between 30-45 seconds before the bot joins the lobby, and unless it crashes, the "party errors" should be ignored.<br>
<br>
This is not meant for use on any production server, and it will most likely never get updated again after this month, enjoy.<br>
<br>
# To use
* Run `npm install` in the extracted directory
* run `node main.js` once everything is set up, and sign in using the "Authorization code" method down below.
* From then, on Fortnite, select BR/Zero Build BR or Reload, make sure to have no fill on, and get ready
* Let it matchmake and you should be in a bot lobby!
<br>
If any bugs are found, report in the issue tracker, thanks!
