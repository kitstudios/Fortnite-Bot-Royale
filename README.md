DOESNT WORK AS OF 13/06/2025

# Fortnite Bot Royale
This is based on AjaxFNC's [NexBL V1](https://github.com/AjaxFNC-YT/NexBL-V1/), i've updated a lot of code to try to stabilize the bot.<br>
<br>
It's mostly stable and usable now, tho it may take between 30-45 seconds before the bot joins the lobby, and unless it crashes, the "party errors" should be ignored.<br>
<br>
This is not meant for use on any production server, and it will most likely never get updated again after this month, enjoy.<br>
<br>
# How to use
Install Node.js, available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download), as it is necessary for this bot to function.

* Run `npm install` in the extracted directory
* Rename the `env` file to `.env`
* run `node main.js` once everything is set up, and sign in using the "Authorization code" method down below.
* From then, on Fortnite, select BR/Zero Build BR or Reload, make sure to have no fill on, and get ready
* Let it matchmake and you should be in a bot lobby!
<br>
If any bugs are found, report in the issue tracker, thanks!<br><br>(P.S: If you have access to Github Codespaces, you can run this! Just click the green "Code" button then click Codespaces and then "Create". If you have access, in the terminal, follow the "How to use" guide and you should be up and running!)

# Authorization code
```diff
- Make sure to be signed into the Epic Games account that will serve as the bot account!! Use incognito mode, or another browser to make sure!
```
