# Fortnite Bot Royale
This is based on AjaxFNC's [NexBL V1](https://github.com/AjaxFNC-YT/NexBL-V1/), which was pretty broken lol
<br>
This is very broken too, expect instability.
<br>
This is not meant for use on any production server, and it will most likely never get updated again after this month, enjoy.
<br>
<br>
# To use
* Run `npm install` in the extracted directory
* rename `env` to `.env` and modify it's contents to your credentials
* run `node main.js` once everything is set up, and add your bot.
* From then, select BR/ZBBR, or Reload, make sure to have no fill on, and get ready
<br>
If any bugs are found, report in the issue tracker, thanks!
